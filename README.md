#### Tech Stack
The application is made up of three separate parts interacting with each other to produce this final output.

1. A frontend using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and an open source circuit drawing tool.
2. A server with Python installed which is responsible for the analysis and computations.
3. A REST API written in Express and Nodejs which glues the previous two parts together.
